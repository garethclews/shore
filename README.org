#+TITLE: dotfiles for shore

The files included here should be enough to replicate the look of the post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/74fewg/xmonad_shore/][here]].
You will need to find and install the following things for your distribution to obtain a minimal working version:

- xmonad
- xmonad-contrib
- conky
- dzen2
- dmenu

* Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Move the things you want to use to ~/.[name]
